Im a computer science major at CSUF and I plant to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

  This was a fun lab because it introduced us to linux,git & GitHub, our text editor (VS Code), and the C++ compiler (clang++), i feel that it gave us the fundamentals to start coding, even tho it was just getting to know how to code it help us a lot later on.

* Lab 5 Part 1

  Even though I wasn't full time in the class because I had to leave earlier but my teammate was really helpful, I only know that we had to calculate the area of a rectangle, but what I liked the most is that my partner was able to understand that I had to leave earlier.

* Lab 6 Part 2

  The second part of this lab was a nightmare for me and my teammate, we were really stuck with the functions, I believe that we were asking for help every minute. But what I would take from this lab is determination and teamwork.
